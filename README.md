AI-based Multilingual Customer Support App
Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced digital world, businesses need to provide efficient, personalized, and multilingual support to their customers. Many customer support systems are limited to a single language or struggle to handle complex customer inquiries. This AI-based Multilingual Customer Support App aims to solve this problem by providing an intelligent, multi-lingual platform for handling customer queries in real-time, making it easier for businesses to interact with customers globally.

The app leverages Google Gemini, Google TTS, and AI-driven natural language processing to provide multi-lingual support for customer inquiries. It detects the language of the incoming message, translates it if necessary, and generates AI-based responses, while also offering a text-to-speech feature for accessibility.
